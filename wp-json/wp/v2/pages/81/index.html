Prior to arriving in Tucson I worked at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, and before that I got my Ph.D. from Lund University, Sweden. I have also held a visiting position at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, China, and taught courses at universities in Russia and Belarus.<br \/>\nMy main research interest is computer security, in particular the so-called Man-At-The-End Attack which occurs in settings where an adversary has physical access to a device and compromises it by tampering with its hardware or software. With Jasvir Nagra, I am the author of Surreptitious Software: Obfuscation, Watermarking, and Tamperproofing for Software Protection, published in Addison-Wesley&#8217;s computer security Series.

This variation has important effects on the reproducibility of systems research and ability to quantitatively compare the performance of different systems. It also has implications for commercial computing, where agreements are often made conditioned on meeting specific performance targets. Over a period of 10 months, we conducted a large-scale study capturing nearly 900,000 data points from 835 servers. We examine this data from two perspectives: that of a service provider wishing to offer a consistent environment, and that of a systems researcher who must understand how variability impacts experimental results. From this examination, we draw a number of lessons about the types and magnitudes of performance variability and the effects on confidence in experiment results. We also create a statistical model that can be used to understand how representative an individual server is of the general population. The full dataset and our analysis tools are publicly available, and we have built a system to interactively explore the data and make recommendations for experiment parameters based on statistical analysis of historical data. Finally, we remark on preliminary developments in our collection of data since the initial 10 month period.<\/p>\n<h4>Short Bio<\/h4>\n<p>I&#8217;m a Research Associate who has been working with the Flux Research Group at the University of Utah since 2016, after receiving my Masters in Computer Science from UC San Diego. In addition to my work on maintaining the CloudLab and Emulab projects, I have been primarily responsible for the large-scale collection of various performance metrics from the servers in the aforementioned projects.

However, decades of work have revealed that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to the bevy of applications that require location information. If every application sets its own requirements, how then do we measure progress in localization technology when each technology sets its own benchmarks? How can we tease apart improvements to underlying physical layer estimates from enhancements to algorithms that process these data points and measure these contributions against the development of systems that exploit fusion to realize better gains than either physical or algorithmic advancements alone? More questions than answers, this talk aims to lay out the state of the field as it is today and to invite discussion on what defines fair comparisons and how\u00a0to enhance the creation of reproducible artifacts, experimental configurations, and location traces and datasets.<\/p>\n<h4>Short Bio<\/h4>\n<p>Pat Pannuto is currently completing his PhD in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at the University of California, Berkeley.

His research interests encompass the development of testbeds and benchmarking infrastructures, as well as the\u00a0 evaluation of the performance of low-power wireless communication protocols used in the Internet of Things and in industrial automation. Among others, he has developed (i) D-Cube, an open-source tool to create large-scale testbeds used to evaluate the dependability of state-of-the-art IoT protocols, and (ii) JamLab-NG, an open-source tool to generate repeatable Wi-Fi interference.
